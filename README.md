<br>
## how it works ?
<br>
This program has two parts that you can remove or add as needed
<br>
To run, you need to move the file to the folder where your photos are located
<br>
The program takes the extension of the photos from you so that it can find them
<br>
It also asks you for the watermark image address
<br>
<br>
### Part One:
<br>
The program selects all the files in the desired folder with the format you entered and merges them in pairs. 2 to 1
<br>
<br>
### Part Two:
<br>
It then transfers the new image to the add watermark function
<br>
In this section, the program asks you to enter the watermark transparency as well as its ratio to the original image numerically between 0 and 1.
<br>
It then saves the newly created images on which the watermark is installed in the Out folder and you can use it.
<br>
Note: Converting Names The program is defined so that the names of image files are numbered
<br>
Personalize for yourself if needed
